This is an attempt to learn phonologically active classes in English. The focus
is on the classes that condition the allophones of the plural inflectional
morphology. 

Using a variety of machine learning techniques, we hope to not only learn the training 
set, but also to extend these classes to previously unseen data. The feature set detailed
in Zsiga's The Sounds of Language (2013) will be the lense through which 
the data is filtered. 

Once these classes have been learned, we will then explore the exact conditions that 
elicit the importance of features within the SPE style rule framework.
